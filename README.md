🚀 New Data Analytics Project: Panic Attack Data Analysis

I recently worked on a project where I connected Snowflake as the data source and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze a Panic Attack Dataset.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Integrated Snowflake with Power BI for seamless data connectivity.

Designed interactive dashboards to explore symptoms such as dizziness, trembling, chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating.

Analyzed behavioral and lifestyle factors like sleep hours, drinks per week, and panic attack duration.

Created visualizations to study correlations between panic scores, triggers (caffeine, phobia, PTSD, etc.), and medical history (anxiety, depression, none).

Enabled demographic breakdowns across age groups, gender, and lifestyle habits.

📊 Tools Used:

Snowflake (data storage & processing)

Power BI (data visualization & reporting)

✨ This project helped me strengthen my skills in data modeling, dashboard design, and deriving actionable insights from healthcare-related datasets.

I’d love to hear your feedback and suggestions! 🙌

Do you want me to also design a 1-slide LinkedIn post graphic (with Snowflake + Power BI logos and key dashboard visuals from your PDF) to make your post more engaging?

Perfect — here’s a polished GitHub README.md draft for your project. It highlights Snowflake, Power BI, and the analysis clearly:
